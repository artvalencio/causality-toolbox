# symbolic-toolbox
Toolbox of information theory measures calculated using the symbolic dynamics from a time-series. 
This version is written in Matlab/Octave.

* cami.m: calculates, for bivariate systems, the Causal Mutual Information (CaMI) in both directions, the Mutual Information, the Transfer Entropy in both directions and the Directionality Index

* camir.m: calculates, for bivariate sytems, the Causal Mutual Information Rate (CaMIR) in both directions, the Mutual Information Rate and the Transfer Entropy Rate in both directions

* totals.m: calculates, for multivariate systems, the Total Correlation (generalization of Mutual Information) and the Joint Entropy of the entire system

Details of each program and usage example is available by typing in the command window: help [function-name]
